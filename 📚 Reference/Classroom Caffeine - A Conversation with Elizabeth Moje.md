# Notes:

- Professor and dean at UofM

- ## One or two moments that inform your thinking now?
	- Teaching history to students who wouldn't respond to text but directing plays with the same students who engaged with that well.
		- Something is not working with MY teaching, so I will study how to better.
		- Take the burden off the learner, and onto the text to be understandable.
		- Led her to further study
	- Teaching to literacy to non-HS-graduates or those who haven't read in a meaningful way.
		- Taught her much more about high-school teaching than actually teaching HS
	- Working to be anti-racist and decolonizing in her research.
		- Working against an implicit bias in her research.
		- Acknowledging EVERYONE where they are.
		- Make *people* prime, not work

- ## What would you like teachers to know about your research?
	- All of her research is rooted in her experience as a teacher.
	- She still is a teacher, but a teacher that studies teaching and learning.
		- Studies how to teach with equity.
	- Her research is justice-oriented
		- Builds on difference and diversity
		- "Where things are different is where newness enters the world."
	- Supporting young people.
		- As children enter adolescence they continue developing and we can't write that off.
		- We don't pay enough attention to the navigating work going on during this time
	- Young people are dismissed and even vilified in our society
		- "Surly, mean, defensive"
		- We should check ourselves as we learn how to talk about young people.
	- Disciplines are cultures
		- Different ways with words
		- And different words themselves.
		- Disciplinary literacy is a way to work easier together, but also a way to exclude outsiders.
		- Critique the way that we communicate with people.
	- Everyone should have access to the ways to access the world.

- ## Justice and equity: what can teachers start doing today?
	- It depends on who the teacher and learners are.
	- Dont reach for something you arent ready for because you may produce harmful results.
	- 4-E framework
		1. Enact the practices
		2. Engineer students capacity to engage
		3. Examine words and ways with words
		4. Evaluate words and ways with words in the discipline
	- There are many ways to organize and describe things.
	- Many of the current ways that things are organized and described are rooted in white, male inventions.
	- 4-5 yr olds are members of disciplines, asking questions all the time.
		- They are shut down and relegated towards the person of authority (teacher)
		- This shouldn't be.
		- The drive to learn why things work is largely gone by the time kids are done with school
		- Give the autonomy back to students.

- ## Given the challenges of today's educational climate, what message do you want teachers to hear?
	- Teachers are in the most important profession.
	- Their work touches every other profession.
	- This makes them absolutely ESSENTIAL
	- Other countries value this much more than USA
	- Society cant function without us.
	- You are valued, respected professional.
		- This is a message that is not out there enough.
	- There is a chipping away of the professionalism of the teaching *profession*
	- PLEASE DONT LEAVE THE PROFESSION
	- Keep the light alive
