# Notes:


## Scheduling
Principals have all of the power.

When schedules change, get on the committee to have a say in the process.

Recruiting and retention is so important

Be prepared to teach other courses
- Band
- Orchestra
- Choir
- Drama
- Music Appreciation
- Ock and roll
- Math, social studies, etc.

## Watch Master Teachers
**Get out of your building as much as possible and watch amazing music educators.**

- You will learn so much from a teacher who knows their craft
- Soak it in.
- Reach out and contact them.
- Talk to your principal - they will let you go.

## Choose the right literature
Get on JW Pepper and *listen*

Check the state lists.

Let it fit the ensemble

You can rewrite parts to help the instrumentation

Don't choose music you played in college, HS, community bands, intern teaching...

Ask others for help in selecting

Check out the FB page.

## Join the state music association
MSBOA and MMEA

Go to Festivals, S&E, Marching Fest, Honors Bands, etc

Networking

## Parents control their child's schedule
Don't be upset when a student can not attend a required event!

Don't take it personally
Parents juggle crazy schedules
Kids need to balance band, sports, and work
Weekend performances are hard
Work with the student

## Kids want to be a part of something great (and have fun)
Music kids are goofy
Find moments wot joke around and build relationships
Crazy moments in rehearsal are okay
Kids want to be in a great program and have fun too
Think about sports: who likes to play on a bad team?

## Treat staff like gold
We are not all friends, but we are friendly
Everyone is stressed out - dont take it personally
Teachers treat their area like its the most important thing in the world
Communicate pullouts early and often
Find ways to recognize the cool things staff members are doing
NEVER badmouth another staff member

## Communication is key
*Families are busy, give them lots of info!*

Send a newsletter to all families.
"This week in band"

Websites
FB Page
Keep it up to date, otherwise no one will use it.

## Be a master teacher
**_It Takes Time and Practice!_**

Be able to play all the instruments.
Piano and choral skills
Steal great ideas from other great teachers
Be prepared for rehearsals, *DON'T WING IT*

## Invite clinicians and other teachers to help you and your groups

MSBOA has a list of retired (emeritus) teachers
Reach out to those who live in your area
Utilize the music stores, they will send out their reps
Buy them lunch, gift card, etc.
Your kids will love it, it shakes up rehearsal

## Learn how to say no...
Prioritize extracurricular activities and events
If it is not included in your schedule B pay, you don't *have* to do it.
Don't burn yourself out - burnout is real

## ...but do as many things as possible
*To a point.*

Trips (day trips and overnight)
Music department dances and lockins
Special performances outside of school
Performances at elementary schools
Assisted living homes

## Middle school is where it's at!
Starting kids on their instrument is the best
Amazing growth between 6th and 8th grade
Middle schoolers are fun
Summer vacation
You do less than HS counterparts

## Its all about relationships
**This is why we do what we do.

## Set strict boundaries and have fantastic classroom management
This is especially important in your first few years of teaching
The age difference is too slim
Don't be friends, demand excellence and they will grow to love your class.
Hold your ground and have high expectations for rehearsals

## Eat lunch in the staff lounge
Avoid eating with students
Don't give up your lunch - this was negotiated by contract
Let your lunch be a safe haven

## First job - take anyone you can get
Be prepared to move away from home
Don't be picky, unless you get multiple offers
Your first job doesn't have to last forever
You will most likely end up in a small town

## Don't complain on social media
No one cares

Vent to friends, family, co-workers about your job
Avoid social media at all costs
No one wants to hear teachers complain

## Remember, it's just a job
Work to live, don't live to work
When your retire, you will be replaced quickly
There is no glory
Seek out hobbies
Embrace family time
Leave issues at school
