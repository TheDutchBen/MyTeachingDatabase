# Notes:

## Readers Constructing Meaning:
Three parts: the reader, the climate, the text features

The reader:
- Previous experience that the reader brings to the understanding

The climate:
- The time and place that reading happens
- The environment we create around reading.

The text features:
- The layout and physical aspects of the text.

## Traditional model of teaching reading
Assignment given, silent reading, discussion on the reading

## What is the ultimate goal of strategy instruction?
Teaching students how to teach themselves. 

Examples:
- Teaching how to effectively practice fast material.
- Teaching how to read music when it's brand new to you.
- Teaching how a student can fix their own tuning by listening and adjusting.
- Relate difficulties to things the students have already accomplished.

## The Metacognitive Edge
BDA (before, during, after) and questions to help students monitor their own reading and become better readers. 

*Preparation, assistance, and reflection*

Preparation:
- Arouse the curiosity.
- Consider background knowledge.

Assistance:
- Help make connections and monitor understanding.
- Implement strategy teaching.

Reflection:
- Encourage students to reflect on key concepts.
- Provide opportunities for thinking, talking, and writing.

## Prereading activities to increase understanding

### Front-loading
Build background knowledge

Teach vocab

Set a purpose

Focus attention to specific aspects

Cue relevant reading strategies

## Activity

*Look over the text and identify:*

- What is the text about?
	*Music and musicians' roles in ancient Greek society*
- How is it organized? 
	*Looks like it may be a music history textbook*
- Consider the Frontloading strategies:
	- What makes the text accessible or challenging? Who might struggle and why?
		*The small columns and lots of pictures are challenging to juggle. I had trouble finding the next lines. It's distracting. Someone with background in music or history may have an easier time. 
	- List two to three ideas you have to build background knowledge about the text.
		*Talk about music's place in modern society, ask what the student's prior knowledge of Greek history and mythology is, ask what students think of when they hear ancient music.*
	- What are some important features to point out before reading?
		*Point out how the text flows on the page to get around the formatting. *
	- Write one question you would ask students to think about before the reading.
	- Challenge:
		- What is a question to ask while they read?
		- What is a question to ask after they read?
