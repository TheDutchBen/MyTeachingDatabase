# Notes:

## Four ways to create a literacy rich environment:

Establish and maintain a safe and supportive environment where collaboration is valued.

Strive to improve students' identities as learners, their attitudes as readers/writers, and their interest in reading/writing.

Teach content, topic knowledge, and discipline's text structures and styles.

Teach reading and writing strategies like real experts in the field.

## Writing to learn

**Writing is the ultimate reading strategy.**

Don't make writing a punishment. Let there be feedback.

Imagine yourself as a teacher:
- Identify who, besides the teacher, would be an authentic audience for students to write for.
	- Program notes for a concert audience.
	- Grant application reviewers.
	- Scholarship reviewers.
	- Fellow students.
	- Parents.
- What might be a topic or two that would matter to your students?
	- What the music means to them.
	- How they perceive music.
	- What lyrics mean to them.
- What might be a more creative writing medium/genre for students to show their understanding of a topic through writing?
	- Musical compositions.
	- "Picture for music"
