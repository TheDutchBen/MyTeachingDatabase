# Notes:

## SQ3R
### Type of Strategy:
BDA

### What is it?
Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review

Survey
	Relate to the previous knowledge
	Skim the text

Question
	Turn titles or headers into questions
	Write questions that come up during the survey

Read
	Search for answers to the questions

Recite
	Recall answers without looking at the text
	Reread if necessary

Review 
	Summarize what you've learned
	This step varies

### Benefits / Critiques


### Example in Music


## SQRQCQ
### Type of Strategy:
BA

### What is it?
It stands for Survey, Question, Read, Question, Construct, Question
Before and after reading strategy.
Slows the students down so that they can actually gain understanding.

Survey
	Read the problem quickly to gain an understanding

Question
	Ask questions to identify the information the problem is specifically asking to be found.

Read
	Identify relevant information

Question Again

Construct
	Perform the necessary computation

Question Again

### Benefits / Critiques


### Example in Music

A more advanced form of [[#SQ3R]]

## The Final Word Protocol
### Type of Strategy:
A

### What is it?
After reading.

Each student gets a chance to lead the discussion.

Student 1 discusses something for a short time,
Student 2 responds to student 1 for a short time,
then student 3 and 4 respond,
Finally, Student 1 has the last word on the discussion.

Then Student 2 Discusses something, and the process repeats.

### Benefits / Critiques
Builds argumentative skills, allows for friendly debate, builds speaking skills.

Takes a long time.

### Example in Music

## Think Alouds
### Type of Strategy:
D

### What is it?
5 primary skills:
- Make predictions.
- Describe the mental pictures.
- Demonstrate how you connect this to prior knowledge.
- Create analogies.
- Verbalize obstacles and fixup strategies.

Select a passage to read aloud that is challenging to the students. Teach the text-coding symbols and model as you read them. Read aloud and verbalize your thoughts.

Maybe use symbols like check marks and stars to denote certain thought-processes.

### Benefits and Critiques
Not as inherently collaborative as others.
Helps students process how they individually think.
Easy to do at home.

### Example in Music 
This can be transferred into taking notes on sheet music easily. Creating certain symbols for certain reminders is a great way to quickly remind yourself while playing.

## QAR (Question Answer Relationship)
### Type of Strategy:
BDA

### What is it?
4 types of questions, assign short passages for reading, after students demonstrate they understand the question types, assign more short passages.

Types of questions:
- Right there:
	- Information that can be found and answered verbatim. Closed-end.
- Think and search:
	- A question that requires some deduction from multiple areas of the text.
- Author and you:
	- "How do you think the author feels about ____?"
- On my own:
	- Draw your own conclusions, personal reflection.

### Benefits and Critiques
Easily transferable to many different disciplines.
Requires teacher frontloading.

### Example in Music

## Word Classification Shorts
### Type of Strategy:
BA

### What is it?
Students sort vocab into different categories.
Closed or Open:
	Closed is when they have predetermined categories,
	Open is when they create their own categories.
1. Write a vocab term on the board and brainstorm a list of words they associate with the term.
2. Identify categories for sorting the terms into. (open or closed sort)
3. Encourage multiple categorizations.

### Benefits and Critiques:
Helps develop vocab
Helps connect ideas

### Example in Music:


## Structured Note Taking
### Type of Strategy:
D

### What is it?
Helps capture key ideas while reading to help reflect later on the topic. The organizer should be specific to the reading.

Put the title at the top.
Put the three main points in the lower boxes.
(ex. how to play paradiddles: keep 8ths consistent, gradually increase speed, practicing this helps other skills)

### Benefits and Critiques:
Helps identify the important words.
Can be minimizing of the other material.
Could help one student, but be completely unhelpful to another.

### Example in Music:
Score/part study.

## Graphic organizers
### Type of Strategy:
BA

### What is it?
Text can be organized in various ways. Several types of organizers.

- Chronological 
- compare and contrast 
- concept/definition
- description 
- episode 
- generalization/principal 
- process/cause and effect

Introduce the pattern of the organizer, use a familiar example text, have students use the pattern frequently.

### Benefits and Critiques:
Making connections, develops vocabulary, flexible for many situations, incorporate reading with writing.

Requires preparation on teacher side, takes time to explain how to take the notes.

### Example in Music:
Flowcharts, sheet music, timeline, form.

## Knowledge Rating Scale and Vocab Definition Card
### Type of Strategy:
BDA

### What is it?
Knowledge Rating Card:
1. Teacher provides a list of major concepts for the reading.
2. Ask students to rate how familiar they are with concepts.
3. Adjust reading based on response.

Vocab Definition Card: 
1. Provide a brief explanation of a new term.
2. Provide a non-linguistic representation.
3. Rate their knowledge in the term and why.

### Benefits and Critiques:
Very open ended. Wording can be inconsistent. Teaches new vocab very well. Provides a form of assessment.

### Example in Music:
Introduce new stylistic terminology, and then rate their ability to internalize and perform the new terminology.

## Predict, Locate, and Note: Using a graphic organizer

### Type of Strategy:
BDA

### What is it?
Visual display that rearranges the information visually in various ways. 

Predict: Organize what you think the text is about into your organizer.

Locate: Find information that is both known and unknown to you. Organize it into the organizer. Check marks or X's.

Add: Add a box that is for unfamiliar words or concepts and write down those things there.

Remember to have a spot for summary and share with other students.

### Benefits and Critiques:
Helpful for visual learners. Easy to organize in a way that makes sense to the individual student. Can be cumbersome to make an organizer. Forces a linear thinking. Forces into a specific organizer.

### Example in Music:
Flowcharts, mind maps, concept maps, terminology synonyms and antonyms connected.

## RAFT
### Type of Strategy:
After

### What is it?
Role, audience, format, topic

What is the wrters role?
Who is the text for?
What is the best format to present the writing?
What is the topic of the writing?

The students write as a certain role, in a certain format, for a certain audience.

### Benefits and Critiques:
Very versatile, can be used for nearly anything because of the open-ended nature.

Requires a level of critical thought that can be hard to explain.

### Example in Music:
Be a reviewer of a song.
Step into the composer's mind.

## Written Conversation 
### Type of Strategy:
After, discussion

### What is it?
Students pair up, teacher provides ground rules, conversation starter is provided, each student writes a note to the other at the same time and then respond to the letters after a short time. Once the final pass is complete, they are allowed to talk.
