# Notes:

## Five Premises of Teaching Reading

### 1: Readers construct meanings from text.
Schema Theory: When learners are confronted with new information, they try to make sense of it by seeing how it fits in with what they know

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Knowing how to drive a snowmobile because you know how to drive a car.

### 2: Prior knowledge plays an important role in learning.


### 3: Reader comprehension depends heavily on metacognition.
Students have to be thinking about their thinking before, during, and after reading.
You have to teach people how to do metacognition.

### 4: Reading and writing are integrally related.
Avid readers tend to be good writers as well.

### 5: Learning increases with student collaboration.


## Removing Barriers to Entry
Compelling story lines, credible characters, and/or links to real world issues and people.
	The text has to relate to the students' lives.

Illustrations, diagrams, numbered steps, typeface, and/or supportive formatting.

Straightforward or linear plots OR linear-sequenced text.

Simple sentence structure.

### Anything besides a textbook
>[!DEFINITION]
>A text is anything that conveys a set of meanings to the person that examines it.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Music videos 
>Graphical scores 
>Fingering charts 
>Musical word wall
