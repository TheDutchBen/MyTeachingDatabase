## Club vs class - in school vs out of school

Conflicts in and out of school times

Credit conflicts

## Audition vs no audition

Gets the best students, but resticts availability to those that really like to play

"Y'all come" jazz ensembles

## Band students only?

Byron center a good example of not requiring other bands.

## Jazz language

Learned by hearing first.

Modeling, singing, playing

Blues and swing first

Dah, dit, duu, DAHT - articulations

Emphasis on two and four must be ... Emphasized

Lots of accidentals

Blue notes!

## Instrument Specifics

### Brass
Have trumpets stand from beginning

Stand off to side

If Bell is up, you don't need to work so hard

Keep all parts the same for the first few charts
Don't divide at first

Okay to split the lead

### Saxophones
Strongest players on lead alto.
Center of ensemble

Tenor 1 is primary soloist
Closest to rhythm section

Bari sax needs independence
Line up the first parts from to back

### Rhythm Section

Don't be afraid to reehearae the section

No pedals on piano!
Focus on right hand only at first
Root position at first
3rd and 7th is everything
Simple comping

Let them have the freedom to expand off the page

Time is everything for bass.
Timing before pitch
After roots, add the b7 and 2
Make sure they can tune the bass
Anchor the thumb near the fingerboard / fret board
Tuba is okay, but don't just hand them a bass part (down an 8va)

Bass drum near bass
Check coordination with all 4 limbs
Start with ride cymbal and hihat
Once they keep good time, add 4 on the floor
Add snare drum last
One mounted tom is all that's needed
Help them read the notation
Cymbal pattern changes
*Try to get them to understand the form, or number measures*
Simple fills


Guitar provides support
Stick to the 7ths
Play closer to the neck, drier sound
Turn down reverb, no distortion.

### Aux.

Give vibes a flute part, piano part (focus on 3 7)

Let it serve the music

## Swing

Learn the 12 bar blues form
Learn this style first

## Shuffle

Consistent 8th note throughout
The hey song

## Rock
"I Feel Good" in 12 bar form, different style
Bass drum heavier

## Latin

8th straight
Clave important
BD 1 &3 &1...

## Improvisation

Nothing to fear

Start with ONLY 2 notes.
Add the blues scale for more advanced players

Everyone solos, take volunteers first. Judgement free zone

When a solo is done, clap

Trade 2s

In Bb: Bb, Ab, F
Add notes gradually

Mixolydian scale
Blues scale
Dorian scale
Lydian-dominant for advanced
Leave theory for later

Utilize iReal Pro

Practice on mic

### Background Figures

Alternate sections
Not every time through
