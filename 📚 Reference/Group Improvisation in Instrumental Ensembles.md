# Notes:

## What is group improvisation?
Free improvisation.
Focused within predetermined boundaries
Opportunity for experimentation

Step outside of conformism and "standardness"

## Melody
Parameters set to a preexisting simple melody
Opportunity for differentiation

### Reinventing
Slower / faster
Quieter / louder
Accent every X notes
Change the rhythm
Etc.

When it gets strange, that's the point.

### Reflection
How fast did you decide to sing the melody?

Why did you choose to sing it that way?

If you did it again, what would you change?

## Canvas of Sound

Many different instrumental sounds in a collective space.

Be respectful of peers, classroom environment.
Play instrument properly
Play with correct posture
Play with confidence

### Reflection
What instruments did you hear? 
We're you able to respond to the sounds you heard?
Are there instruments you will listen for next time?

## Form for group improvisation
Choose boundaries
Focus on specific musical skills
Change between the boundaries.

1: Quarter note rhythms
2: Quiet dynamics
3: Crescendos
4: Decrescendos

### Reflection
Draw a picture of the music we just played.

Describe what we just drew. Why is it like that?
