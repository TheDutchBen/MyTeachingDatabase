## What is a text set?
A collection of sources that support a common theme or topic.

Includes a variety of sources, levels, genres, etc.

## Why use a text set?
Allows the student to select to their own taste within the discipline.

Builds knowledge by scaffolding through an anchor text about a topic that enriches all aspects of the reading experience.

Extends knowledge and skills to other disciplines through authentic content in reading, writing, and research.

Learning more about the world around them.

Keeps track of new knowledge.

Learning and owning new vocabulary.

## Three questions to help get started making a text set:

1. What standards can this help meet?
2. What do I, the teacher, want students to know?
3. What topics/themes/content will engage and excite the student?

## Steps to create a text set:

1. Start with the content.
	1. What do students need to know?
2. Select an anchor text.
	1. This is a complex grade-level text.
	2. The anchor text could be the focus of a close reading with instructional support in the classroom.
3. Build the text set.
	1. Find material that supports the content you want to teach and want students to learn.
4. Organize the text.
	1. Determine how and when will you use the texts.
	2. Will some be independent, jig-sawed, whole class reads?
5. Curate activities to use texts.
	1. Decide how students will work with the texts.
	2. What will they do with the texts? How?

## Creating a rationale for your text set

### Student engagement.
- What do you think would make a text set more or less engaging?
	- Think about the students that struggle with literacy.
	- Think about the students that struggle with engagement or who have a fixed mindset.
- In what ways could this text set invite them in to become more proficient in your disciplinary community?

### Knowledge building.
- How will this text set build COMPLEX knowledge of your discipline?
- What kinds of vocab could they learn?
- What other knowledge will students learn through engaging with these texts?

### Habits of Experts.
- Which reading habits of experts will the students rely on or become more proficient in?
- How will you know they have developed more expertise?
- What would they be able to do?
