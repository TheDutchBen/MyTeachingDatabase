# Notes:

## Prologue

The vibe is really good in the prologue. Idk how, but it is a very evocative writing.

"I feel infinite"

"Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent"

## Part 1

### August 25, 1991

X person who is (character trait)... An interesting way to par down someone's character in a few words.

"For the rest of the school test, the teachers treated me different and face me better grades even though I didn't get any smarter."

"It makes me wonder if I have problems at home" is interesting, because we never really do know how good or bad we have it when isolated.

The way the seemingly traumatic experieces are downplayed by very simply describing the reactions of people in the room as "quiet" works very effectively.

What happened to their aunt? 

It's very obvious that this is a child's voice.

### September 7, 1991

Susan's character arc.

She seemed unhappy, he seemed unhappy.

Doesn't decorate his locker, cried after beating up the bully. Realizes he's emotional. Being emotional as a boy is stigmatized.

Charlie's current goal is do good in school, And make a friend.

### September 11, 1991

Likes to read books twice. 

Misses his brother, but strange because they didn't talk much and still don't.

### September 16, 1991

Child's voice still prevalent, switches topic midway through a paragraph.

Charlie's sister seems fake. 

"I guess he stood up to his bully, and I guess that makes sense." RAW line

"And my mom was quiet." Only character trait of his mom so far other than drinking wine.

Damn this book got hands. The last paragraph is great!

### September 18, 1991

"My brother used to tell poilish jokes, which I know is wrong, but I just blocked out the polish part and listened to the jokes. Hilarious."

His sister now listens to the tape that she discarded. Seems that she respects her boyfriend for hitting her and standing up to her essentially. Weird dynamic.

### September 29, 1991

"To tell you the truth, I don't know where they are appropriate to use. I'm not saying you shouldn't know them. You should absolutely. But I just have never heard anyone use the words "corpulent" and "jaundice" ever in my life. That includes teachers. So, what's the point of using words nobody else knows or can say comfortably? I just don't understand that."

Is Charlie autistic?

Is Charlie's mom cheating? 
"Sometimes my dad calls her beautiful, but she cannot hear him."

Charlie seems really good at understanding the deeper meaning sometimes, and other times can't grasp a surface level concept.

Charlie has seen his dad cry. A truly emotional touchstone.

"Incidentally, I only have one cavity, and as much as my dentist asks me to, I can't bring myself to floss." 
Interesting off topic from the rest of the previous tirade. Implies ADHD or lack of executive functioning? Autism?

Charlie is great with words.

### October 6, 1991

I love the way that charlie describes his middle school circle. They're just characters to him, and as he drifts apart from them and grows, he starts to make deeper and more meaningful connections to those around him.

Patrick and Sam seem to really adopt Charlie

Charlie feels ashamed for dreaming about Sam.

### October 14, 1991

Let's play the game, is Charlie autistic or only immature for his age...

Honestly I envy autistic folks. They seem so carefree most of the time.

"Charlie has a Charlie-esque crush on me..."

"It's just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life"

"Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve."

First time we've heard the mom speak.

DAMN THIS BOOK GOT HANDS

"'I hate you.' My sister said it differently than she said it to my dad. She meant it with me. She really did. 'I love you,' was all I could say in return."

You're a freak, everyone says so, they always have... I'm not trying to be.

"I put my head under my pillow and let the quiet put things where they are supposed to be."

A positive turn of events for the readers' opinion of Charlie's family.

### October 15, 1991

"I *wasn't* raised very religiously because my parents went to catholic school. But I do believe in god very much."

The loss of innocence begins to take form.

### October 28, 1991

Writing letters to "figure things out."

I love Charlie pretending to be old and coming back for homecoming. So cute and funny. And the fact that Sam and Patrick don't question it, and just accept that it's Charlie being Charlie is so wholesome.

Buried or married, I don't remember which one. Such a true sentiment for younger kids being dragged along to things.

Going to a high school party. A weird thing that I myself never was invited to.

Oh boy a rape episode. Yikes it's uncomfy. Especially since it happened in front of a fucking child.

Good thing Sam sensed Charlie's anger.

Oh innocence. Charlie is too pure.

"Baked like a fucking cake."

Oh no poor Charlie... He's gonna be baked soon

Woah! There's some LGBT in here! 

"It was a stolen type of kissing."

Music is a emotional touchstone to Charlie

You're a wallflower. You see things, you keep quiet about them, and you understand.

Oh lovely Charlie. I'm tearing up reading this. 

"When we got out of the tunnel, Sam screamed this really fun scream, and there it was. Downtown. Lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder... I swear we were infinite."

WOW!
