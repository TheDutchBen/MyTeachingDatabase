## What is a mindset?

Fixed to growth continuum

Fixed:
- Gives up easy
- Fear judgement 
- Feel threatened 
- Avoid challenges 
I stick to what I know, and hide what I don't.

Growth:
- Inspired by others
- Embrace challenges 
- Learns from criticism 
- Effort for mastery 
When I fail, I learn

*Adam Grant* is a name to know

The goal isn't to dwell on what went wrong yesterday, it's to discover what you can do better today. -Adam Grant

## How to get it in the classroom?

### Positive classroom environment
- Energy 
- Engagement 
- Less fear 
- Investment 
- Process 

Ask and answers. Allow for them to grow independently.

### Openness to Collaboration
Colleagues, composers, Zoom, make mistakes!

Let the students know that you aren't always right, you are growing too.

Model the growth for your students.

Critiques are conversations

Don't judge yourself too harshly. Put yourself in the same safe space you make for others

### Redefine Success
Process vs product
Improvement
Administrators' wants
Class Structure
Community

### Growth Centered Rehearsals
Language
Positive
Reinforcing
Encouraging
Collaborative

### Growth Centered Assignments
Focus on goal setting instead of time tracking

What did you work on?

What practice strategies did you use?

Practice doesn't make perfect, practice makes prepared
