# Notes:

Warm up on own after greeting students.

Dynamic contrast and precision are a focus this rehearsal.

Breathe together, play together

Simply reminding them to listen seems to help

Set a standard for soft

Do you feel it slowing down? 
Yes. 
Well don't do that!
(Continue with specific reasons why it's slowing down)

Rehearsal with a metronome is a good thing to improve pulse and to get a feel for the piece at a different tempo

*Precision: lining up the hands

Saxophones don't change your voicing before you change notes!

Y, do you hear X?
Yes.
Play with them.
X, do you hear Y?
Yes.
Play with them.

Directing the students ears towards a specific part seems to help precision. 

Take it from "just notes" to music
What is music designed to do? To make you move, and to move you! So move!

Why do we put on a concert?
We love to play. For people!

*I like how he balances taking time out of playing to talk about the philosophy of music.*

*Just taking a pause, or talking a little softer makes the kids stop talking so they listen. If they are already keyed in to you before this point.*

Read the program notes

Make the long notes and short notes seek out each other. "Microphrasing"

Remind them what you're teaching them.
