# Notes:

Students already are independent musicians.

In the classroom, we typically focus on dependent and interdependent Musicianship.

*Actively teach independence in music*

Independent Musicianship is making musical decisions that matter on their own.

Thinking processes are as important as the technique.

## Big Idea
Teaching the thought processes by teaching, modelling and coaching and releasing the responsibility.

## The Cycle
1. Planning before playing
2. Strategy to practice 
3. Performance 
4. Reflection 

Take this process and release the ownership to the students. 

*How do we get the students to develop an aural image before they play?*

### Planning phase
Audiate, hum, sing, solfege, move
Touch the key sig and impacted pitches
Show me the articulations
Look at this phrase, what is the challenge?

**Use action verbs** to get them to think about it themselves. Don't show it to them for them

This shows that students need to have a thought process before playing

### Rehearsal Techniques
Now that we have an aural image, we need to practice it.

Scat the rhythm with them.
Take the instrument away and use your voice.
"Let's try again with dividing and subdividing on our body."

*Tie the musical problem to the method.*
"We want to clean up the technique, so let's slow it down "
"The intonation was poor, so let's sing buzz and play and use a drone."
"Our focus is a steady pulse, so let's use the metronome."

Let students into your teaching process so they can teach themselves.

"The articulation was muddy, so what would you do to fix it?"

Try to let them solve the problem.

### Reflection step
Students need specific prompts ahead of time for what to listen for.

*Guided reflection*

"Thumbs up/thumbs down"
"Which *blank* was best?"
Record and reflect

Let the students give feedback to each other.

*Did our earlier strategies work? How can we fix it if it didn't?*

Be specific in your guided reflection.

Start the cycle again

## Modeling is the most important step

## Activities for class
Record themselves practicing and reflect out loud.

Unison melody "game"
- Take a melody and have everyone phrase it differently.
- This let's them practice making musical decisions.
- Have someone else, who is not looking at the notation, guess what the decision they made was.

Toolkit: articulation, tempo, dynamics

Chamber ensembles as a regular part of rehearsal

Orpheus-style piece

**Ask the students!** This is the most powerful tool
