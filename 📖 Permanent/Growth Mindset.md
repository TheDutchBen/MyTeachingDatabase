# Notes:

A growth mindset, in contrast to a fixed mindset is looking at everything with a future goal in mind. You feel like every experience is an opportunity to grow, instead of being *fixed* and resigning.

Being open to criticism and willing to admit mistakes is a great way to embrace a growth mindset.

Jump into challenges head-on and always be asking to take on new challenges.

*When I fail, I learn.*

You have to redefine success to focus on the process instead of the product.
