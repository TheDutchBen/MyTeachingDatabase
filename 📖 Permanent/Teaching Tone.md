# Notes:

## General
Air is the fuel for your tone.

**Modelling is Key**

Warm air for brass and flute
Cold air for woodwinds

Most tone problems will be improved by pulling up a music stand.

## Flute
Use warm air and make sure the air is properly directed toward the opposite edge of the tone hole.

Focus the aperture and find the sweet spot for resonance.

Don’t cover up too much of the tone hole with the bottom lip.

## Oboe
Make sure the reed is pushed all the way in and there is enough reed in the mouth as to not play flat – beginners need to use lots of air.

Keep the teeth open and round the corners of the mouth.

## Clarinet
Play with firm corners (directed forward and down) and a flat chin.

Keep the throat open and shape the oral cavity similar to how it would be for a “hiss” (we call this a “_HEE_ hiss”).

Whistle, pull corners down.

Flat chin.

## Saxophone
Use a more rounded embouchure and allow the corners to cushion the mouthpiece (much like a drawstring).

Saxophones use “jaw vibrato,” but make sure your students don’t misunderstand this concept. Saxophonists should use the syllable _YAH_ for vibrato and start with the lower lip. Too much “jaw” movement is detrimental to the sound.

## Bass Clarinet
Use a softer reed than the woodwind counterparts.

Use a more rounded embouchure and allow the corners to cushion the mouthpiece (like the saxophones).

## Bassoon
Use _OH_ for the desired oral cavity syllable.

Keep the chin down and back, but not as pointed as for clarinet.

## Brass
Use warm air and be aware of oral cavity syllables for voicing.

Keep the airstream energized.

Use _OH_ for basic tone production.

For low brass, use a _DAH_ or _DOH_ syllable, which will help brass players move large quantities of slow-moving air.

## Percussion
Wrist and arm tension are a percussionist’s worst enemies. When applicable, pull the sound out of the instrument – don’t bang on the instrument.
