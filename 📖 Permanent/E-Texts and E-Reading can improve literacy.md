# Notes:

E-text provides more direct and easy access to multi-modality in learning.
[[Multimodal Literacy]]

The [[Universal Design for Learning Framework | UDL Framework]] is an excellent way of guiding the design of new learning tools. E-texts provide many ways of meeting the three design principles of the UDL.

Useful for facilitating a [[Inquiry Unit]]. Being connected to the internet is a great way to go down a rabbit hole of learning.

Text to speech and narration are two ways to accommodate multiple learners of various ability.

McGraw Hill Connect is a great example of a multimodal e-text. It offers learning options that do not all have to be interacted with, but can if the students choose to use them.

Ultimate Drill Book is also a good tool for multimodal learning.

You must still teach how to use the tools that are provided.
[[Teaching Practice]]

Helpful for teaching to [[Digital Natives]].
