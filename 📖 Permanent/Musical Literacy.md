# Notes:
How do you define literacy within your discipline area?

- In music, literacy is being able to understand the intent of other musicians (composers, ensemble partners, conductors, etc) and communicate your own intent to create a cohesive musical idea.

What do you believe are the two to three most important skills for a student in your discipline area?

- Know the style in which you are playing.
- Be familiar with your instrument's technique to the point where it is not inhibiting your musicality.
- Be creative, and interpret the music through your personal sphere of knowledge.
