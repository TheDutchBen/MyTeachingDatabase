# Notes:

## General
Speed of air vs volume of air.

Use numbers at first.

Focus on being smooth in crescendos and decrescendos.

Don’t allow the fundamental quality of the instrument to change when changing the volume.

Keep an uninterrupted airstream.

“Every note is a pearl”

Most ensembles can play MF beginning to end.
The **BEST** bands can play PP all the way to FF.

It's easy to play loud, it's hard to play soft.
