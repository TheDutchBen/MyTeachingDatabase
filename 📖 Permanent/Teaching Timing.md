# Notes:

## General
Both encompassing pulse, and rhythm within the pulse.

Must play precisely in time before learning to let the music breathe.

Metronomic precision is not the end-goal.

START with the pulse externalized, TRANSITION to internalized pulse.

Start by clapping, tapping, etc.

Ween them off of that dependency eventually.

Rhythmic vocabulary is an important concept. Introduce common rhythmic “words.”

Do you feel it slowing down? 
Yes. 
Well don't do that!
