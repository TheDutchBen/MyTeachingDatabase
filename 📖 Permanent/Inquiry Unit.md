# Notes:

A unit of learning where students can explore topics with gradual release of responsibility. There are 4 kinds of inquiry:
- Confirmation
	- The teacher confirms the knowledge of the students.
- Structured 
	- Students explain the evidence they discover. 
- Guided
	- Design the inquiry and follow through on their own.
- Open 
	- Derive questions on their own and answer.

The teacher starts to be the guide on the side instead of the sage on the stage.

Misconceptions will arise in this style of learning, but they can be easily quelled.

The idea of an inquiry unit is guided by essential questions that are presented. A *good* inquiry will have intriguing questions that make the students so curious that they cant wait to find the answers.
