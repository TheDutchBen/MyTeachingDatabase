# Notes:

## Tuning Procedure
Start with the tuba. Make sure it's perfectly in tune. Then work up the tessitura of the band. Piccolos last.

## General
What affects tuning more than tuning slides? Embouchure and air.

Concert A for woodwinds.

Concert Bb or F for brass (tenor sax too).

Explain the tuner and cents.

Explain “beats.”

Alternate fingerings by instrument that may make the instrument more in-tune.

Know which notes are the typically oout of tune notes on each instrument.

3rd valve on trumpet

Middle range saxophones

Adjust major thirds down, adjust minor thirds up for just intonation.

Major seconds raised, leading tones raised

Dominant 7ths lowered quite dramatically (over an 8th-tone sharper)

## Flute
Jutt the jaw.

Check end plug.

Concert A on head joint.

Concert A 440 preferred tuning note.

## Oboe
No adjustment required of the instrument.

All in embouchure.

Slight increase in firmness to raise pitch, opposite to lower.

Concert A preferred.

Concert C on reed.

## Clarinet
Mouthpiece and barrel should sound an F#.

Tune open G and C.

Bass Clarinet

Use middle C to center.

C# on mouthpiece and neck combo.

Some brands are D#

## Bassoon
Most pitch flaws are sharp

Use concert A

Sound C on reed and bocal to center.

## Saxophone
Concert A all around is standard.

Ab on mouthpiece and neck on Alto

Concert E on Tenor / Bari.

Open C# is flat and D is sharp.

C#: add side C and Bb keys.

D add low B key.

## Trumpet
Center on concert F.

Lip up or down, and then adjust accordingly.

Avoid adjusting more than just over an inch on slide (at room temp).

Third valve bad. Use the slide.

## French Horn
Concert C for centering

Similar process to trumpet.

Tune each valve slide along with main slide.

Adjust F slide (no trigger, front) from open G

Adjust Bb slide (trigger, back) from 3rd space C

3rd space C# is sharp and 1st line E is flat.

12 and trigger are sharp on A and D in the staff.

Use third valve with trigger.

Right hand flat and open in the bell

As far in as comfortable

"Blow a piece of food off your bottom lip to hit higher notes"

## Trombone
Tune to 4th line concert F

Also, approach Bb by ascending the scale.

This helps not pinch sharp.

Tune similarly to trumpet by lipping.

Fifth partial D, Db and C above the staff are flat.

Use alternate slide positions.

Use your ears to tune as you go.

## Euphonium
Start the same as trombone.

Fix the same as trumpet.

Don’t let slides go further than 2 inches.

Low C, B, F, and E are sharp. Use 4th valve.

12 D and G are sharp

Top of staff C, C#, and D are flat. Use alt fingerings.

## Tuba
Start like trombone

Fix like trumpet and french horn.

Low C, B, F and E are sharp. Use 4th valve.

2nd space / 3rd line C, C#, and D are flat. Use alternate fingerings.
